# Start printing the welcome message

# In the next line prompt the user for a number and leave the cursor on the same line.
# Save the user input in a variable.

# If the user input is not a number greater than 0, ask again until it is.

# Print the message "The first 20 multiples of <user_number> are:"

# Use some looping technique to print each multiple followed by a comma.
# The last one should be preceded by "and"
